            <p>Hi Ariel, how are you? Tell me your all hobbies, favoured things or person, your dreams, and what makes you happy!</p>
            <P>Hi, so far i'm good. I love playing video games especially RPG games, my most favorite games so far are Final Fantasy VII, Final Fantasy XV, Elden Ring, Dark Souls, Persona 4, Persona 5, and CSGO. I do love sports too, like Football, Basketball, F1, E-Sporst off course, and tennis. I love IT things mostly in creative like Editing Videos, Photoshop, and Computer Science.</P>
            <p>My favorite things are Music with rap hip-hop genre and classical music. Then i like Toys especially Gundam, my childhood was filled with rafting Gundam and Lego, last time i rafted a Gundam was when i was in 8th grade so i do really want to raft a gundam anymore. If it goes to my favoured person i'd say Cristiano Ronaldo, he's kinda like a hero to me because i already admire him since i was kid and i can't forget when i used to fight with my friends just because we were debated about Messi and Ronaldo then i remember too i cried when Ronaldo finally lift Champions League trophy in 2014 with Real Madrid, i still remember that i was cried so hard. If you mention about love i don't think i have the most favourable girl in my life so far, because i only had 5 ex when i was in middle school until early high school and there's no one really left me a scar or memorable memories. But actually i still in love with a girl since my 3rd high school untill right now, but i feel like it's an obsession so that's why i wanted to forget her but i can't then i choose to live with it, i don't care if it just one sided at least i have a motivation to keep alive.</p>
            <p>When i was a kid, i used to want to be a Programmer and build a game developing company because i really love video games. Then when i was in middle school i want to be a Pilot but i realize that i can't be a pilot because i'm not tallented and too dumb then i decided to cancel my flight academy into a normal high school. But now i don't have any dream again because like i said to you i lost myself and i lost my motivation to keep living on.</p>
            <p>I'm happy when i do my hobbies and favorite things of course and i would be happy if could live in peace and nobody could bother me when i'm alone that would be my happiest life ever.</p>
