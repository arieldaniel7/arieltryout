            <p>I fall in love with beauty classical music, it brings out emotions within me. I feel like i'm in middle of meadow alone, breeze wind come over my body, it just feels like i'm in heaven.</p>
            <P>----------</P>
            <p>Since i got this disease, whole things are changed from how i act, how i think, how i speak, everything. Despite how annoying this disease to my daily, i'm just grateful it made me changed my whole perspective.</p>
            <p>In my loneliness sometimes i miss the old version of me who got a lot of friends, the talkative one, the funny one, the childish one, but he's now burried deep in memory.</p>
            <P>New version of me isn't bad too tho, he's the most mature than he was, he's now like to learn something new even he's now like a genius i guess, he's more creative, he's now have less selfishness than he was, i just love myself better right now even i'm now on hedgehog's dilemma.</P>
            <p>I read a book "The Meditation of Marcus Aurelius" it teach us about philosophy of stoicism with Marcus life's journey. Marcus was always asked to himself is it the right thing or is it wrong the decisions that he made, he taught us that we can't handle anything we couldn't handle and to focus on ourself not others. He said that "Whatsoever is material, doth soon is vanish away, and fame so memories soon swallowed up by the general of age and the duration of whole" which mean soon we will forget anything and soon everybody will forget us by the time.</p>
            <p>Today as always the mess up paragraph that doesn't link each other, thank u for always read my bullshits.</p>
