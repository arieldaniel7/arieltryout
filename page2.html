            <P>I woke up day by day in a room with the door locked and nobody can reach me unless myself. Leading me to infinite depression and showing lack of complacent. </P>
            <p>I was in self destruction mode. Suicidal thought hunt me so i went running for answer.</p>
            <p>"I'll die" i said, even money couldn't stop a suicidal weakness, then power of love was resurrected my sanity.</p>
            <p>I thought my family hate me but they're not. I thought my friends hate me but they're not. They showed me that they are care to me.</p>
            <p>2021 i spent most of my times to met psychiatrist, she gave me most powerful medicine.</p>
            <p>DREAM.</p>            
            <p>It's been 5 months since last time we met and it really worked, , big thanks to her.</p>
            <p>I grew up being a better person than i was, even i forget who i was 3 years ago. But there is one thing that i couldn't forget....</p>
            <P>One person who i loved really much.</P>
            <P>I don't know how is she right now. My feeling are mixed, i scared, i sad, i mad, worried all around me.</P>
            <p>I'm trying to duck this feeling but it still hunt me. I don't want her to not okay, i wan't all peace of mind around her.</p>
            <p>But i don't know how, how to make her better when she's not okay?</p>
            <p>All this lack of experience, i hate it. Knowing sometimes i'm just annoying person, i look down bad.</p>
            <p>There's beauty in love and lessons in destruction.</p>
            <p>Thank you for keeping me in your thoughts. I've prayed for you all.</p>
