            <p>Life is based on perspective. We might have different perspective.</p>
            <P>Society has been fucked up, what culture we living on. In a society when hurt people is better than hurt people, fuck they calling a culture.</P>
            <p>We fed up with dramas that we've been tired with, all for short clout addict. Social media are fake none of them are real, and we living following the trends.</p>
            <p>Peer pressure driving whole generations, some of peers broke the line, some of peers fixed the line, which one would u lesson?</p>
            <P>We feel all the good, all the bad, all the worries. The culture we living on will evolve, but we'll once again can't avoid bad or good from culture. Living side by side with culture, evolve with the culture, celebrate with the culture, happy with the culture, sad with the culture.</P>
            <p>Can we make a perfect world?</p>
